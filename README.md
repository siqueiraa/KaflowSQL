# The Agony of Streaming Joins is Over

**🚀 KaflowSQL v1.0.0 - Time-windowed streaming ETL with SQL-native temporal joins**

---

Picture this: It's 3 PM on a Friday. Your product manager walks over with "a quick request" – they need real-time user personalization live by Monday.

You have `user_actions` in one Kafka topic and `customer_profiles` in another. In a relational database, this is a trivial `LEFT JOIN`. In the world of streaming, it's the beginning of a multi-week project involving Apache Flink or Spark Streaming, complex state management, and a new set of services to operate and monitor.

KaflowSQL turns that typical Friday afternoon crisis into a 30-minute task. The entire pipeline is defined in a single YAML file — it reads from Kafka, performs the transformations, and writes to a new topic:

**What if joining streams was as simple as writing SQL?**

```yaml
# That's it. Your entire streaming pipeline.
name: user_personalization
query: |
  SELECT 
    a.user_id,
    a.action,
    a.timestamp,
    p.subscription_tier,
    p.full_name
  FROM user_actions a
  LEFT JOIN customer_profiles p ON a.user_id = p.user_id

output:
  topic: personalized_actions
  format: avro
  key: user_id
```

**KaflowSQL transforms days into minutes.** This isn't syntactic sugar – this declaration is the source of truth for a self-contained, high-performance engine that handles everything: consuming from Kafka, managing join state, handling out-of-order events, and producing results with exactly-once semantics.

## Performance That Speaks for Itself

Real numbers from production workloads:
- **100K+ events/second** throughput per pipeline
- **Sub-millisecond** join processing latency  
- **Minimal GC impact** with Go's low-latency concurrent collector and zero-copy design
- **Single binary deployment** – no cluster management overhead

*Tested on Mac M3 MAX - your production servers will be even faster.*

## From Complex to Simple: Real Use Cases

### 🔒 **Fraud Detection** (Financial Services)
**Before**: Multi-week Flink project with complex state management  
**After**: Single YAML file deploying in minutes

```yaml
name: fraud_detection_prep
query: |
  SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    t.amount,
    u.risk_score,
    u.account_age_days,
    m.merchant_category,
    m.country
  FROM transactions t
  LEFT JOIN users u ON t.user_id = u.user_id
  LEFT JOIN merchants m ON t.merchant_id = m.merchant_id
  WHERE t.amount > 100

output:
  topic: fraud_detection_input
  format: json
  key: transaction_id

emission:
  type: smart
  require: [risk_score, merchant_category]
```

### 🛒 **Real-Time Personalization** (E-commerce)
**Challenge**: Join user clickstreams with product catalog data  
**Solution**: Instant personalization with configurable data quality controls

```yaml
name: personalization_engine
query: |
  SELECT 
    c.user_id,
    c.page_view,
    c.timestamp,
    u.subscription_tier,
    p.category,
    p.price,
    h.last_purchase_date
  FROM clickstreams c
  LEFT JOIN user_profiles u ON c.user_id = u.user_id
  LEFT JOIN products p ON c.product_id = p.product_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase_history h ON c.user_id = h.user_id

output:
  topic: personalized_recommendations
  format: avro
  key: user_id

state:
  events:
    default_ttl: 1h
    overrides:
      clickstreams: 30m        # High-volume, short retention
      purchase_history: 24h    # Purchase patterns change slowly
  dimensions:
    - user_profiles            # User demographics rarely change
    - products                # Product catalog is mostly static
```

### 🏭 **IoT Monitoring** (Manufacturing)
**Challenge**: Combine sensor readings with device metadata  
**Solution**: High-throughput processing with minimal latency

```yaml
name: sensor_enrichment
query: |
  SELECT 
    s.device_id,
    s.sensor_value,
    s.timestamp,
    d.location,
    d.device_type,
    c.threshold_config
  FROM sensor_readings s
  LEFT JOIN devices d ON s.device_id = d.device_id
  LEFT JOIN device_config c ON s.device_id = c.device_id

output:
  topic: enriched_sensor_data
  format: avro
  key: device_id

emission:
  type: immediate  # High throughput, partial data acceptable
  
state:
  events:
    default_ttl: 5m  # High-volume, short retention
  dimensions:
    - devices
    - device_config
```

## Why KaflowSQL? The Architecture Difference

### 🎯 **Specialized, Not Generic**
Most streaming frameworks try to do everything. KaflowSQL does one thing exceptionally well: **stateful SQL joins on Kafka streams**.

### ⚡ **Co-located State for Speed**
- **Embedded RocksDB**: State and compute on the same node
- **Sub-millisecond lookups**: No network latency in the hot path
- **Hash-based sharding**: 256 partitions for concurrent processing

### 🧠 **Temporal Stream Processing Engine**
- **Time-windowed joins** with configurable retention and late-arrival handling
- **Intelligent state management** separating fast streams from slow dimensions
- **DuckDB integration** for complex SQL operations and aggregations
- **Zero-copy architecture** minimizing allocations and memory pressure

### ⏰ **Sophisticated Windowing**
- **Business-driven TTL**: Configure retention from minutes to days based on data velocity
- **Per-topic temporal control**: High-volume events (30m) vs user sessions (4h) vs static lookups (never expire)
- **Late-arrival handling**: Process out-of-order events within configurable time windows
- **Automatic temporal cleanup**: Memory-efficient state management prevents bloat
- **Dimension vs event separation**: Static reference data never expires, events have business-appropriate TTL

### 🎛️ **Smart Emission Control**
Choose between completeness and latency:
- **Smart mode**: Emit only when required fields are populated
- **Immediate mode**: Emit as soon as any data is available
- **Fine-grained TTL**: Per-topic expiration with dimension tables that never expire

## 🚀 Get Started in 2 Minutes

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Create your pipeline
cat > pipelines/my_pipeline.yaml << EOF
name: user_enrichment
query: |
  SELECT 
    e.user_id,
    e.event_type,
    e.timestamp,
    p.subscription_tier,
    p.country
  FROM user_events e
  LEFT JOIN user_profiles p ON e.user_id = p.user_id

output:
  topic: enriched_events
  format: json
  key: user_id

emission:
  type: smart
  require: [subscription_tier]

state:
  events:
    default_ttl: 1h          # Business-appropriate retention
    overrides:
      user_events: 2h        # Longer for user journey tracking  
  dimensions:
    - user_profiles          # Static reference data never expires
EOF

# Configure Kafka connection
cat > config.yaml << EOF
kafka:
  brokers: ["your-kafka:9092"]
  schemaRegistry: "http://your-registry:8081"
  useAvro: true

state:
  rocksdb:
    path: /data/rocksdb

## Windowing Strategies for Different Data Patterns

### **Multi-Velocity Stream Processing**
```yaml
name: customer_360_windowed
window: 24h

query: |
  SELECT 
    e.user_id,
    e.event_type,
    e.timestamp,
    p.email,
    p.tier,
    t.last_purchase_amount,
    s.support_tickets
  FROM events e
  LEFT JOIN profiles p ON e.user_id = p.user_id
  LEFT JOIN transactions t ON e.user_id = t.user_id  
  LEFT JOIN support s ON e.user_id = s.user_id

state:
  events:
    default_ttl: 1h           # Most events are short-lived
    overrides:
      events: 2h              # User interactions need longer correlation
      transactions: 24h       # Financial data patterns evolve slowly
      support: 7d             # Support tickets have long resolution cycles
  dimensions:
    - profiles                # User profiles are slow-changing reference data

emission:
  type: smart
  require: [email, tier]      # Wait for essential profile data
```

**Why This Works:**
- **High-volume streams** (events) get short TTL for memory efficiency
- **Business-critical data** (transactions) gets longer retention for pattern detection  
- **Slow-changing dimensions** (profiles) never expire, always available for enrichment
- **Late arrivals** are handled within each stream's appropriate time window
